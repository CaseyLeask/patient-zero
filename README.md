============

A Zombie.js web crawler. Point it at your sitemap / homepage and it'll spread through your site, giving you a list of all client-side errors it encounters. I built a first version of this as a smoke test for some legacy code.

Installation
============

Install Zombie.js http://zombie.labnotes.org/#Infection

Run the command `node crawler.js http://path.to/page.html`

Testing
=======

Run the command `npm test`
